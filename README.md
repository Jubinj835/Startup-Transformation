# Startup-Transformation
In this project, I analyzed the data for a tech startup that is looking to improve its operations after a global pandemic has taken the world by storm.

I apply data transformation techniques to make better sense of the companyâ€™s data and help answer important questions such as:

Is the company in good financial health?
Does the company need to let go of any employees?
Should the company allow employees to work from home permanently?
